My dotfiles for vim, tmux and i3

## Zsh Setup
Nothing fancy here. Just used the defaults from [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

## Vim Setup

Vim-plug for plugin management.

Copy the `.vimrc` and `.vim` folder to your `$HOME` directory

Run `PlugInstall` to install all the plugins

The plugins are located under a seperate file named `plug.vim` inside the `.vim` directory

## tmux setup

tmux setup is preety straightforward. I have used a starter pack from [Oh My Tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux). Follow the installation directions and just replace the `.tmux.conf.local` file in the `$HOME` directory.


> The necessary fonts are located on .fonts folder. Copy the fonts to ~/.fonts
If the installed fonts doesn't show up on the preferences of your terminal.
You will have to install `Gnome Tweaks` and setup the system wise fonts. The font I have used is `Fura Code Mono Medium`

## Troubleshoot
You should also install xbacklight and pulseaudio for your volume keys and brightness control keys to work.
```
#For volume controls
bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec --no-startup-id pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 +5% #increas    e sound volume
bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec --no-startup-id pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 -5% #decreas    e sound volume
bindsym XF86AudioMute exec --no-startup-id pactl set-sink-mute 0 toggle # mute sound
   
#Sreen brightness controls
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec xbacklight -inc 5
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec xbacklight -dec 5 
```

If your xbacklight does not work by default and using intel graphics
Add these to your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file, if it does not exist by default create one.

## i3 showing default icons and themes

If you have been using i3 alongside other de, i use cinnamon btw, you might generally see that it will not load your icon themes and others that you have set.
To can change this visually by using `lxappearance` command.
