My dotfiles for vim, tmux and i3

## Vim Setup

Vim-plug for plugin management.
Copy the `.vimrc` and `.vim` folder to your `$HOME` directory
Run `PlugInstall` to install all the plugins
The plugins are located under a seperate file named `plug.vim` inside the `.vim` directory

## tmux setup

tmux setup is preety straightforward. I have used a starter pack from [Oh My Tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux). Follow the installation directions and just replace the `.tmux.conf.local` file in the `$HOME` directory.
